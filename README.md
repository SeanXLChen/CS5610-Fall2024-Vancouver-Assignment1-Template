# Assignment 1: Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the Personal Portfolio Assignment! Your goal is to create a simple, static personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS. You will work within the `src` folder provided to you.

## Project Structure

Inside the `src` folder, you will find the following starting files:
```
  src/
  ├── index.html         # Your main landing page
  ├── css/
  │   └── style.css      # Your main CSS file, external styles should go here
  └── images/            # Store your images here (optional)
```

### Instructions

1. **Create Your Portfolio Pages**:
   - Begin by editing the `index.html` file. This will be your portfolio's landing page.
   - Create at least **2 additional HTML pages** (such as `about.html`, `projects.html`, etc.) that showcase your work experience, projects, education, hobbies, or other personal details.
   - Ensure that **all pages are connected via a navigation menu** with links to the other pages.
  

   Example:
   ```html
   <nav>
     <ul>
       <li><a href="./index.html">Home</a></li>
       <li><a href="./about.html">About</a></li>
       <li><a href="./projects.html">Projects</a></li>
     </ul>
   </nav>
   ```

2. **Design Your CSS Stylesheet**:

  - In the `src/css` folder, you will also find the `style.css` file. Use this file to define the styles for your HTML pages. You should apply consistent styling across all pages for headers, footers, navigation, and content sections.
  - Make sure to use proper CSS practices such as:
    - Use external styles (in the `style.css` file) rather than inline styles.
    - Utilize selectors, classes, and IDs appropriately.
    - Ensure your styles create a visually appealing and consistent layout across all pages.
